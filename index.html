        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
          Hi, I’m Grace, a frontend web developer with a passion for building
          intuitive, responsive, and engaging user interfaces. With a year of
          experience in crafting websites and web applications, I specialize in
          turning ideas into dynamic, user-friendly digital experiences. My goal
          is to create beautiful and functional websites that not only look
          great but also provide seamless interactions for users.
        </p>

        <p>
          My journey into web development began when I discovered the power of
          coding to bring designs to life. Starting from basic HTML and CSS,
          I’ve since expanded my expertise to include modern technologies like
          JavaScript, React, and CSS frameworks such as Bootstrap. I love
          staying on top of the latest frontend trends, whether it's
          experimenting with new tools or optimizing performance for a faster,
          more engaging user experience.
        </p>

        <p>
          I’m skilled in building responsive websites that work across all
          devices, ensuring smooth and consistent functionality. From working
          with APIs to implementing complex animations, I thrive on projects
          that challenge my creativity and technical expertise.
        </p>

        <p>
          Outside of coding, I’m passionate about exploring new technologies.
          This interest helps me stay inspired and push the boundaries of what’s
          possible in frontend development. I believe that continuous learning
          is key to staying ahead in the fast-evolving world of web development.
        </p>

        <p>
          I’m always eager to collaborate on exciting projects or discuss new
          ideas. Whether you're looking to build a sleek new website or improve
          an existing one, feel free to reach out—I’d love to help bring your
          vision to life!

          I’m passionate about the ever-evolving world of technology, especially
          the creativity and problem-solving that come with frontend web
          development. I love the challenge of turning complex ideas into clean,
          functional, and visually appealing websites that users enjoy
          interacting with.
        </p>
        <p>
          What excites me most about tech is its constant innovation. I’m always
          eager to dive into new frameworks, tools, and methodologies,
          especially those that push the boundaries of what can be achieved on
          the web. Whether it's exploring the latest JavaScript features,
          improving web performance, or experimenting with modern CSS
          techniques, I thrive on staying ahead of the curve.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’m also fascinated by the intersection of design and development,
          particularly how user experience (UX) shapes the way people engage
          with technology. Understanding user needs and delivering seamless
          interactions is something I constantly strive to improve in my
          projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of coding, I enjoy learning about emerging tech trends like AI
          and machine learning, as well as staying connected with the frontend
          development community through blogs, forums, and open-source
          contributions. This passion for continuous learning keeps me inspired
          and motivated to build better digital experiences.
